# Description: describe the terms below

# a. Pseudocode: 
# Pseudocode is a simplified, informal high-level description of a computer program or algorithm. 
# It is written in a way that mimics the structure of a programming language 
# but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. 
# It's often used for planning and explaining algorithms.

# b. Algorithm: 
# An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a particular problem. 
# In the context of programming, 
# an algorithm can be understood as a sequence of instructions 
# that a software program will follow to complete a specific task.

# c. Data Attribute: 
# In object-oriented programming, a data attribute 
# (also known as a field or property) is a variable 
# that stores some data associated with an object. 
# Each instance of a class has its own copy of the data attributes defined in the class.

# d. Method: 
# A method is a function that is associated with an object. 
# In object-oriented programming, 
# methods define the behavior of an object and can access 
# and modify the data attributes of the object they belong to.

# e. Constructor: 
# A constructor is a special type of method in object-oriented programming 
# that is automatically called when an object is created. 
# It's typically used to initialize the data attributes of the new object. 
# The name of the constructor method is usually the same as the name of the class.
